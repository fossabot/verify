## GENERAL RULES ON EDITING THIS FILE ###
# 1. Check the spec docs (docs/YAML-Reference.md) and our custom YAML schema at .vscode/schemas/custom-yaml.json
# first before editing. We recommend to use VS Code-compatibile editors with YAML extension (redhat.yaml)
# 2. If unsure on what type and to avoid syntax errors, always surround vaules with double-quotes, unless stated in the YAML spec.
# 3. Don't forget to lint and prettify your YAML files with `./bin/prettify-yaml-file lists/creators/slug-name.yml`.
# 4. Remove any unused fields, including annonations, especially if you copied this template to add a new entry.
