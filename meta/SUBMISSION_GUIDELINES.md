**Authors**: Andrei Jiroh halili

**Date Effective**: N/A

## TL;DR

The legalese version (aka the long form version) sounds boring to read? Here are some pointers you need to remember:

* New creator or publisher within the last 3 months? You need to wait abit longer. Once reached the 3-month-old, you can submit your request here.
* While we want to have communities, creators and publishers of all sizes, our response times and review times may varies. Please don't expect too much.
* In case we're unavailable to merge your PR, the open-source community is allowed to review and handle these requests and PRs as needed to help the maintainers (us + some trusted members of the community).
* We don't usually look at any track records on new entries and on regular basis, so please do your own homework before submiting and note that in an special comments field/section of your issue.
